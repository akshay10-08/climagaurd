Decentralized Parametric Insurance DApp using Chainlink
# 🌱 ClimaGuard

**Tagline**: _Decentralized parametric insurance to protect vulnerable communities from climate disasters._

## 🚨 Problem

Many vulnerable communities face repeated climate disasters (floods, droughts, storms) but lack affordable, automated insurance. Traditional providers delay payouts, require excessive paperwork, and exclude low-income groups.

## 💡 Solution

ClimaGuard provides instant, trustless, **parametric insurance** powered by **Chainlink Oracles**, **Chainlink Automation**, and **AI-enhanced data feeds**. Insurance payouts are automated using verifiable external weather data, enabling fair and fast support.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Solidity** (Smart Contracts)
- **Chainlink Oracles** (External weather data)
- **Chainlink Automation** (Auto claim checks)
- **HTML/CSS** (Frontend)
- **JavaScript + Web3.js** (Wallet + Contract)
- **IPFS** (Optional for off-chain proof)
- **Remix** or **Hardhat** (Dev)

## 🏗️ How It Works

1. Users buy insurance policies by paying a small premium.
2. Chainlink Oracles fetch real-time weather data.
3. If a disaster threshold is met, payouts are auto-triggered.
4. Everything is verified on-chain with no intermediaries.
